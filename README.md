This is a custom Rostock build that allows for easy implementation of a line driven system rather than a typical belt driven one.

Parts are based off of:
Johanns original Rostock design ( https://github.com/jcrocholl/rostock )    
Richrap's 3DR pulley design ( http://richrap.github.io/3DR-Delta-Printer/ )  
piit79's Modded Rostock Parts for the carriage and platform ball-links ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31642 )
